                    Heat the ghee or oil in a large non-stick pan. Add the paneer and sauté on all sides until lightly golden brown. Be careful as it can splutter. Once golden, remove the paneer from the pan and place into a colander to while you prepare the rest of the curry.
Into the remaining ghee or oil, add the cumin seeds, black pepper, asafoetida, ginger, garlic, chillies, curry leaves, coriander and onions. Sauté for 4-5 minutes over a low heat, until the onions soft and begin to caramelise around the edges.
Add the tomato, turmeric, garam masala and salt. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the tomatoes soften. Mash them down with a spoon as they cook to create a thick paste. If you notice the mixture begins to burn, add a small splash of water. Mix until you start seeing ghee or oil separating at the sides of the pan.
Finally, return the fried paneer to the pan and mix to coat all the pieces in the masalas. Continue to cook and heat through for 1-2 minutes. Sprinkle with additional coriander (optional) and serve.

To cook the Chicken:

Heat 6 tbsp oil in a heavy bottom pan and add the sliced onions.
Fry on high heat for around 12 mins till the onions are light brown.
Add the ginger garlic paste and fry on low heat for 2 mins.
Now add the chicken pieces, mix and fry on high heat for 2-3 mins. 
Add the ready made Biryani Masala, mix and fry on medium heat for 3 mins after adding a splash of water. 
Readymade Biryani Masala usually contains salt, hence salt is not added while cooking the chicken in this recipe. Do check if the biryani masala you are using has salt in it.
Now add the sliced tomatoes, mix it well and cook on medium to low heat for 4-5 mins till soft.
Keep the heat on low and add the whisked curd/yogurt. Give a mix and then add the chopped coriander and mint leaves.
Cook on low heat for 2 mins till oil separates. 
Cover & cook on low heat for around 20-25 mins till chicken is tender. Remove lid after 10 mins, give a mix and close the lid again.
Dry up any excess water to get a thick gravy. 

To cook the Rice:

Take one more heavy bottom pan & add around 2.5 litres of water.  Place it on high heat. 
You may include the water in which rice was soaked in this 2.5 litres for enhanced flavour & taste. 
Once the water starts to boil or bubble, add Shah Jeera - 1/2 tsp, Green cardamom 4,  Cloves - 4, Cinnamon 2 pieces and Salt- 2 1/2 tablespoon (two and half tablespoon)
Stir it well to dissolve the salt completely . The water must be very salty. 
Once the water starts boiling, add the strained basmati rice & stir it well. 
Continue to boil it on high heat, stirring few times very gently to not break the rice.
After 8-9  minutes when the basmati rice is almost done (90%) remove it from heat and strain the water. Set it aside.
